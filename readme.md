## How It Works

### Dynamic Rain Simulator

The Enhanced Rain Simulator provides a soothing visual of raindrops falling on your screen. Here’s a quick overview of its inner workings:
	1.	HTML Structure:
   	•	The main interface displays a droplet and a “Toggle Rain” button.
   	•	A dedicated container holds the dynamically generated raindrops.
	2.	Styling:
   	•	Utilizes TailwindCSS and custom CSS for a modern, gradient-rich design.
   	•	CSS animations (e.g., @keyframes fall) create a realistic rain effect by simulating the movement of raindrops from the top to the bottom of the viewport.
	3.	JavaScript Functionality:
   	•	The toggleRain() function controls the creation and removal of raindrops.
   	•	Raindrops are given randomized horizontal positions, delays, and speeds to mimic natural rainfall.
   	•	The effect can be toggled on and off by the user, ensuring that the experience is both interactive and customizable.

### Sleep Soups Guide

Alongside the rain simulator, the Sleep Soups Guide provides seven detailed recipes designed to help induce sleep. Each recipe is interactive and includes:
	•	Ingredient List & Method:
   	•	Detailed descriptions of each ingredient (including traditional names in Chinese) and step-by-step preparation instructions.
	•	Health Benefits:
   	•	Clear explanations of the natural, therapeutic effects of each recipe, emphasizing the role of traditional Chinese medicine in promoting relaxation and sleep.
	•	Interactive Elements:
   	•	Checkboxes: Mark recipes as “tried” to update a progress bar, helping you track your journey toward better sleep.
   	•	Recipe Adjuster: For the “Soupe Apaisante,” a tool allows you to scale ingredient quantities by entering a multiplier.
   	•	Math Calculator & Notes: Integrated tools enable you to perform quick calculations and save personal notes, which are persisted using local storage.
