This project created by Kevin Marville as part of the Earth Day Celebration Challenge (https://github.com/Kvnbbg/EarthDayCelebration) features an interactive Enhanced Rain Simulator that produces a soothing dynamic rain effect and a Sleep Soups Guide with 7 healthy recipes—including adjustable ingredient quantities, progress tracking, a math calculator, and a personal notes section—all designed to help you relax, fall asleep, and enjoy a better night’s rest.
